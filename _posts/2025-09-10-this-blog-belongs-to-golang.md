# Introduction

Go (or Golang) is a fast, statically typed language designed by Google.  
It focuses on simplicity, concurrency, and performance — making it great for cloud services and system tools.

In this tutorial, we’ll write our first Go program.

# Installing Go

You can download Go from the [official website](https://go.dev/dl/).  
After installation, verify the version:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, ScriptKiddie!")
}
```
